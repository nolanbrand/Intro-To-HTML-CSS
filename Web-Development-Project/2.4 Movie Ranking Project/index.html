<hr>

<h3>1. Gladiator</h3>
<p>Though not historically accurate, this movie has lots of action and drama. Very exciting and well worth a watch!</p>

<h3>2. Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>Includes one of the most realistic dipictions of the beach landings on Omaha beach during WWII. It depicts a platoon of men going into enemy lines to rescue a man whose brothers were all killed in action. </p>

<h3>3. Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p>In a dystopian London, a group of troubled young men are in a gang that terrorize the people. The leader, Alex is arrested and put through an experimental treatment program which alters his psyche to force him to behave like an upstanding citizen.</p>
